# DataMiningProject: Fake Google Reveiws Alaska

## Team members: Nick Sietsema, Rebecca Toland, and Amber Tin

## Project Description
Reviews are heavily used for purchasing decisions and those that are fake can be detrimental for customers and businesses. According to a 2016 study by the Pew Research Center, 82% of U.S. adults say they at least sometimes read online customer reviews before purchasing items for the first time, and 40% of that group say they almost always or always do so. Businesses can purchase fake reviews to improve their ratings, search results, and sales. Although the FTC is cracking down on review fraud, artificial intelligence tools threaten to compound the problem by cranking out far more fake reviews that appear highly authentic. Therefore, efforts to eliminate fake reviews is imperative in order to protect customers and support honest businesses.
The purpose of our project is to detect and classify online reviews into real or fake through feature engineering and rule based classification. We will validate our model using a test dataset that has real and fake review class
## Summary of question(s) sought and the answers

How many reviews per day would we expect the normal customer to post?
* The average mean reviews per day is 1.
* The average 50% of users of reviewers per day is 1.
* The maximum reviers per day is 46.

What is the average words per review per user?
* The mean is 38 word per review.
* 50% of users is 22 words per review.
* The maximum words per review is 1,489.
  
Can we uncover paterns and use data mining to detect fake reviews?
* By using the K-means data mining technique, we discovered that the average word count was a big detector for fake reviews. If the word count was under 200, it fell into the fake reviewers cluster.

## Application of this knowledge
The application of this knowledge can help protect consumers and honest businesses. Overall this will help prevent wasteful spending. Consumers do not want to waste their time and money, so honest review platforms would conclude to higher quality products and services.
